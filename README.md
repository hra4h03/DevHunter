# Chatly

Chatly is a simple chat application built with React and Nest. It allows users to create chat rooms and send messages to each other in real time.
The messages are not stored in a database, so they are lost when the server is restarted.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm run client install
$ pnpm run server install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run client start:dev
$ pnpm run server start:dev
```
